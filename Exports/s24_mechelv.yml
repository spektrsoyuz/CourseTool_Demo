    desc: This course provides an engineering project experience that is representative
      of automotive industry projects, except it is scaled down such that it can be
      performed in one school term. The project begins with setting specific and measurable
      goals in a project statement. This is followed by researching and brainstorming,
      producing design alternatives, selecting concepts, and developing and analyzing
      concepts. Project updates are required throughout the course. A mid-term and
      final oral presentation are mandatory, along with the submission of a final
      written report. This course satisfies the ME Senior Design Project requirement.

    desc: The phenomena of vibration and waves provide a fundamental background necessary
      to approach a wide variety of applications in physics and engineering. The first
      part of this course will introduce students to the basics of vibration, including
      the effects of real damping, response to driving forces, nonlinear oscillation
      and application to several acoustical, optical, electrical, and mechanical systems.
      After this introduction to vibration, the course will focus on wave motion.
      The behavior of non-dispersive waves in solids, acoustic sound waves, electromagnetic
      waves, and transverse waves on a string will be discussed along with an introduction
      to Fourier analysis as a means of analyzing wave signals. Non-dispersive waves
      in non-uniform media will also be explored with applications to several different
      types of waves occurring in nature. Basic wave phenomena including reflection,
      refraction, diffraction and interference will be discussed with respect to a
      variety of wave types. Students successfully completing this course will be
      well prepared for further study in optics, acoustics, vibration, and electromagnetic
      wave propagation.

      include phenomena of reflection, refraction, total internal reflection and their
      application to imaging systems consisting of lenses and mirrors. Physical optics
      will start from the electromagnetic wave nature of light and will focus on such

      dispersion of light. Limited topics in interaction of light with matter, crystal
      optics, optical properties of materials and their applications in such areas
      as optoelectronics, photonics and fiber optics will also be addressed. The lab
      investigates optical component analysis, ray tracing, interferometry, diffraction,
