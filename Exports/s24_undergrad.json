Although often regarded as frivolous, unintellectual, and even childish, the popularity and reach of comic books superhero narratives makes them a valuable site of social critique, through examination of the ways they reflect, reinforce, or challenge the ideological positions of the culture that produces them. Consequently, this course makes use of superheroes and superhero stories to ask questions like: What makes a hero a superhero and a story a superhero story? Why are superheroes so popular in America? What do superhero stories tell us about ourselves? These questions serve the two primary goals of the course. First, to become familiar with the characteristics of the superhero narrative by engaging with and writing about a variety of literary and popular texts, tracing the figure of the superhero in narratives across an array of genres, from the novels and pulp fiction of the early twentieth century to the transmedia empires of today. Second, to explore some of the cultural issues and rhetorical functions communicated through and served by superhero narratives, particularly with respect to what they reveal about ideas like justice, power, and identity and issues of race, class, and gender.",

How does technology and speed affect humans’ relationship with each other and the natural world? Do technological artifacts have a politics and an ethics? How might we rethink our relation to energy to further equitable, sustainable practices and climate resilience?
